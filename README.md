|------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Q1   | Fragment Length Frequency Distribution                          | Plots histogram of fragment lengths from sequence data.                     |
| Q2   | Rescaling Frequencies                                           | Normalizes the fragment length distribution for comparison.                |
| Q3   | Viterbi Algorithm for Hidden Markov Model (HMM)                | Implements the Viterbi algorithm to decode the most probable state sequence.|
| Q4   | FASTA Formatting of Predicted Sequences                        | Formats sequences into standard FASTA format.                              |
| Q5   | V-Plot Generation                                               | Plots sequence characteristics using a V-plot visualization.               |
| Q6   | PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on Sequence Features        | Applies PCA to reduce dimensionality and visualize feature clusters.       |
